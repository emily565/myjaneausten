<p>I did not read her letters, and these are my assumptions of her based on her books and some general known trivia.</p>
<p>She grew from Catherine to Emma, from Emma to Lizzie, from Lizzie to Anne, and from Anne to the full-fledged Jane Austen. She always possesed a great wit and carried herself proudly, but lacked experience and self-observation. She loved her only sister, teased her brothers, and adored her father, even though she was aware of their faults. She experienced love, but loved her freedom more.</p>
<p>PS: It would be great to pick more favourite adaptations, 2-4 perhaps? Otherwise it might be quite an easy victory (but I admit that there is bias, funnily, a half of the adaptations I watched are based on Emma).</p>
