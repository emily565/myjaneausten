<p><h3>About MyJane</h3></p>
<p>Hello!  Welcome to MyJane, a blog dedicated to researching modern perceptions of Jane Austen and her works.  I started MyJane because everyone I meet always has a different idea of Jane Austen: stuffy aunt, forward-thinking feminist, writer of (*gasp*) boring novels.  I wanted a place to catalog all of these differing opinions.
    I plan on analyzing the data to look for trends around how people feel about Jane Austen over time.
