<p>Masterful writer, who uses her knowledge of society and literature to provide social commentary and poke at commonly accepted ideas and societal conventions, while understanding the need for them. Independent, partly by choice, partly by necessity, never compromising on her beliefs, but still able to doubt herself every now and again. Died way too young.</p>
