<p>We'll never know exactly how she was as a person but I think she was a phenomenal writer, way ahead of her time. Sometimes I wonder if she even was a romantic herself or simply gave readers what she knew they wanted and wrote her stories primarily to give her commentary on society and politics (and how we've been sadly misinterpreting her work and missing the actual point decades later, calling it 'romance'). </p>
