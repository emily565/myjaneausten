<p>When conversation was an art form and entertainment was something you made for yourself, Austen was the witty and clever companion you wanted nearby.  Her perspicacious eye would bring humor to any afternoon walk or dinner party.  Her ability to see beneath the behavior of pretentious neighbors or insincere relatives would give you much to discuss.</p>
<p>Since I was not born in her age, I have her books and letters to act as our go-between.</p>
<p>They let me enter her world.  Her characters have become friends that I have a concern for. Her life has taught me much about fortitude and resilience. She shows the way to celebrate small successes.</p>
<p>She is an example of the many ways a woman can make a difference in the world. She inspires me to be my better self. </p>
