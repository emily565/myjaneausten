<p>Jane Austen might not have traveled far by horse, ship, or foot. But her novels show that her intellect and imagination traveled farther than anyone in our century could. Every time I read her work, I marvel at how a single writer who lived to be only 40 can speak to so many readers across the globe about so many profound life experiences. </p>
