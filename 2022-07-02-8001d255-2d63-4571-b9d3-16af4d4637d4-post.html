<p>Jane Austen is a timeless writer. She wrote about humans, their qualities and flaws, with a great variety of characters and settings. She teaches valuable lessons about life and how circumstances can influence our choices without making them good or bad.</p>
<p></p>
<p>She is the kind of author that one can re-read all their life as one's perspective changes with age and experience. </p>
<p></p>
<p>She is a dear friend to read in times of need!</p>
